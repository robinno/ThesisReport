\chapter{Initial Difficulties during the implementation}

Disclaimer: This chapter is for amount of work :)

\section{Using Vivado HLS and Xilinx SDK}

\subsection{learning HLS in examples}

Ik moet nog starten met HLS, nog nooit gedaan.

learning HLS

lab1: BASIC WORKFLOW: How to make project, difference between sources and test bench, GUI and it's components, simulation, synthesis (=> estimate and Gantt chart), viewing resulting VHDL code, co-simulation, view simulation waveforms, IP Core export, creating multiple solutions and comparing, setting a directive (like unroll a loop).

lab2: DATA TYPES adhv FIR filter: floating point VS fixed point, saturation with fixed point, fixed point with larger internal bit-width (LSB laten vallen), 

lab3: INTERFACES:
- basic argument-level interfaces (ap\_vld, ap\_none, ap\_hs)
- block-level interface of pipelined component (pipeline on the top function)

lab4: ARRAYS: Sequential, pipelining internal loop, rewind parameter, top function pipelining, array map, array partition (cyclic and complete), array reshape technique

\subsection{Learning how to program target board}

hello world via Xilinx SDK => baremetal 
-> zelf kiezen waar uitgevoerd + dataverplaatsingen zelf implementeren


\section{SDSoC}

Op een Linuxdistributie.

Snel functie verplaatsen van PS naar PL.

gebruikt ook delen van HLS

\subsection{learning process on matrix multiplication example in SDSoC}

Eerste test: matrixmultiplicatie

lab1: INTRODUCTION: basic workflow, working with hardware accelerators, running the project, ...

lab2: performance estimation: rescource utilization, comparing software and hardware implementations, overall speedup comparison (all using LINUX hosted)
