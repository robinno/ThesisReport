From the Brno University of Technology I would like to thank the following people:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Ing. V\'aclav \v Simek} as my supervisor for providing feedback on the process of executing this thesis, as well as helping with the administrative side of the Erasmus exchange and recommending courses at BUT.
	\item \textbf{Ing. Tom\'a\v s Mart\'inek, Ph.D.} for providing the learning materials towards HLS and to point out the idea behind the BFAST algorithm.
	\item \textbf{Ing. Vojt\v ech Mr\'azek, Ph.D.} for providing the ZCU 104 evaluation kit hardware
\end{itemize}

From KU Leuven I would like to thank the following people:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Ing. Jonas Lannoo
		Ph.D. Student} as a supervisor for his support from Belgium during my Erasmus towards the thesis.
	\item \textbf{Ing. Sammy Verslype} for the original idea to try and pick a subject where I try to accelerate an algorithm using an FPGA equipped platform.
\end{itemize} 

I would also want to thank \textbf{Friedel Nollet, Ph.D.} for the original idea of implementing the genome mapping problem, as well as fact-checking my thesis for the biology part and providing me with sample data.

This thesis was executed during my time on an Erasmus exchange with the Brno Univerity of Technology. I would also want to thank the BUT for accepting me as an incoming Erasmus student.

Furthermore, I would like to thank \textbf{ir. Joan Peuteman, Ph.D.}, \textbf{ir. Hilde Bonte} and \textbf{Ing. Michaela Studena} for helping me in the administration needed for the Erasmus exchange.
