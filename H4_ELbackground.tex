\chapter{Platforms for accelerating Smith-Waterman}
\label{ch:Platforms}

As we saw in the analysis of the Smith-Waterman algorithm in \ref{expl:SWanalyse}, we can see that the value of each cell in the matrix is only dependent on the left-upmost 3 cells. Therefore, It leads us to believe that this algorithm can be accelerated on other hardware solutions which are better equipped for parrallellism than a normal CPU.

reading from sd card so not a lot of information exchange needed
if necessary => FTP

bv. SATA, PCI, ...
