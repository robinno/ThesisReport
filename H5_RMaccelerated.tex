\chapter{Initial approach with pure Smith-Waterman}

\section{The concept}

\section{System implementation}

first started on PC

structs with pointers back

typedeffing stuff so easy to change on board

Migrating to board => changing to sdsalloc + how to change starting function (insertion point) => main!!.

file reading => segmentation fault? => wrong path!

refactoring

FASTQ: https://github.com/Illumina/Isaac3/tree/master/src/data/examples/PhiX/Fastq

\section{Possible initial speedups}

\section{Problems with this initial approach}

computational complexity: O(mn)
